// In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.



// It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:

// You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

// Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.



// For this challenge, assume there are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.



// IMPORTANT your console.log output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

// Example Input

// e.g. If you are 56 years old:

// lifeInWeeks(56)
// Example Output

// You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.

function lifeInWeeks(age){

    var anosRestantes = 90 - age;
    var dias = anosRestantes * 365;
    var semanas = anosRestantes * 52;
    var meses = anosRestantes * 12;
    console.log( "você tem " + dias + " dias " + semanas + " semanas, e " + meses + " meses restantes");

}

lifeInWeeks(12);
